Basic Recipe Website.

Access: https://raysroom.github.io/odin-recipes

This short project allowed me to create a small website with a couple web pages. I was able to practice creating a boilerplate, using basic HTML elements, and basic formatting of a website. The project also served as a way to practice using git and practice using different relative links between files.
