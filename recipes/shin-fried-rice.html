    <p>A drunk food special that's quick and delicious when you want to be creative with your instant noodles</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A pack of instant noodles</li>
        <li>Boiling Water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of neutral cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup of cooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 chopped up green onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crush instant noodle pack into small rice-size pieces. If you're working with a cup noodle, instead transfer the ingredients into a ziploc bag and crush them to the same size.</li>
        <li>Cook the instant noodles inside a pot with boiling water. If using the cup, add water just until the noodles are covered.</li>
        <li>While the noodles cook, begin cooking egg in a nonstick skillet with the oil.</li>
        <li>Once egg is just about cooked, add the rice and stir until heated through and glazed in the oil, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain the noodles (if you cooked using a pot) and add them into the rice and egg.</li>
        <li>Add the flavor packet and stir until everything is lightly toasted, about 2-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a plate or bowl, top off with green onions, and enjoy hot.</li>
        <li>If you'd like more traditional fried rice, feel free to cook any extra meats or vegetables separately before starting the rice, add these after the noodles are added to the pan(after step 5).</li>
    </ol>
